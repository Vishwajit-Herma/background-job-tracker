# Contributing to Background Job Tracker

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/background_job_tracker.git
   cd background_job_tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   uv sync

   ```

3. Set up pre-commit hooks
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install

   ```

4. Start development services
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Run migrations
   ```bash
   just migrate
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run tests
just test

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov


# Ensure coverage is above 80%
```

### 4. Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
just format

# Lint code
just lint

# Type check
just typecheck

# Run all checks
just check
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user profile page"
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication bug"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
git commit -m "test: add tests for user model"
```

Commit types:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions or changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title describing the change
- Description of what changed and why
- Link to any related issues
- Screenshots if applicable

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use type hints where applicable
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

```python
# Good
def calculate_user_subscription_total(user_id: int) -> Decimal:
    """Calculate the total subscription cost for a user."""
    pass


# Bad
def calc(u: int) -> Decimal:
    pass
```

### Django Specific

- Follow [Django coding style](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/)
- Use Django's built-in utilities when possible
- Keep views thin, move logic to models or services
- Use class-based views appropriately

### Testing

- All tests must be function-based (no class-based tests)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

```python
@pytest.mark.django_db
def test_user_can_update_profile(user):
    """Test that users can update their own profile."""
    user.first_name = "Updated"
    user.save()

    updated_user = User.objects.get(pk=user.pk)
    assert updated_user.first_name == "Updated"
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
- Use Google-style docstrings

```python
def calculate_total(items: list[Item]) -> Decimal:
    """Calculate the total price of items.

    Args:
        items: List of items to calculate total for.

    Returns:
        Total price as Decimal.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If items list is empty.
    """
    pass
```

### Documentation Files

- Update relevant documentation in `docs/`
- Add examples where applicable
- Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes
